# Winston's VIM Configuration
Its simple, you could do it yourself. Mostly hosted so I can move it between computers easily.

## Deprication

Depricated in favor of [combined dotfiles repo](https://git.sr.ht/~wrmilling/dotfiles)

## Install
This repo assumes it is installed in ~/.vim and the install.sh will symlink .vimrc and install Vundle+plugins. It will complain about missing themes during install, just allow it to continue.
